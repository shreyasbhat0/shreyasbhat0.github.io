> **Invariant** *(noun)*: A property of a system that remains true regardless of the environment or the operations applied to it.

I am **Shreyas K S**, a **Principal Engineer** and Systems Developer. This site is my documentation of the invariants I have found in software engineering.

In a world of distributed chaos—network partitions, race conditions, and non-deterministic LLM outputs—our job is to create systems that hold their truth.

### Core Languages

I build primarily with:
* **Rust** (Systems & Safety)
* **Go** (Concurrency & Services)
* **Python** (AI & Scripting)
* **TypeScript** (Full-stack Agents)

### The Stack

My work focuses on tools that enforce correctness at the compiler level, the consensus level, or the agentic level:

* **Systems Engineering**: Rust patterns, Memory Safety, High-Performance Computing.
* **Blockchain**: Distributed State, EVM Architecture, Finality.
* **AI & Agents**: Building deterministic workflows around probabilistic LLMs.

### Contact & Socials

I am active in the open-source community. You can find my code and thoughts here:
